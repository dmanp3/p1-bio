		<p> was born in seattle and spend most my life growing up in Everett 20 miles north of Seattle. I graduated from Mariner High School in 2009 and then went to North Seattle Community College and Edmonds Community College on a athletic scholarship for basketball. I transfered to Eastern Washington University. I became interested in design early in my life but especially when I took a class in high school where we learned Photoshop and I competed in a logo competition to recreate the Civilian Conservation Corps 75th anniversiry logo.
